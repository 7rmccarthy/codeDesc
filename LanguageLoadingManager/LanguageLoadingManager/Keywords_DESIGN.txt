# This file is going to represent a keyword template for keywordpackage files.
# Those files are going to be in a CSV kind of design.
# Putting '#' in the front of the line is defining a comment.
# At the beginning of a file, you need to define the language and the file extension for that specific language. (Splitted by ';')
#
# Each next line is going to define a keyword, containing:
# -> The word itself
# -> The color of the word
# -> A boolean which defines if the current word is meant or the next one (with a ' ' (space) in between)
